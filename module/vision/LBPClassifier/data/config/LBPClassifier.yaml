# LBP Classifier Configuration
#  Configures the Local Binary Pattern type to be used to histogram images.

# Sampling Points determine number of pixel comparisons made for each pixel
# samplingPts: 8

# LBP Type {LBP, DRLBP} determines method of calculating the histogram
typeLBP: DRLBP

# Noise Limit is the maximum difference in pixel value of which two pixels are considered 'equal'
noiseLim: 0

# Number of channels used to compute the histogram of the image {Y, Cb, Cr}
numChannels: 1

# Divisor to normalise the LBP histogram output
divisorLBP: 7000.0

# Divisor to normalise the DRLBP histogram output
divisorDRLBP: 25000.0

# Training stage determines if the data is to be used to produce a training model (training) or to be
#			compared to a already defined model (testing)
trainingStage: TRAINING

# Draw determines whether or not the histogram will be drawn to NUsight
draw: true

# Image Sampling Region Width
width: 50

# Output determines if the histogram will be saved to file
output: true
